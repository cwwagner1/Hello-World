# Hello-World
My First Repository

Hello All,

My name is Chris and this is my first repository on GitHub.  I am currently working through GitHubs tutorial on how to utilize the site.  I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science and intend to obtain a career as a software engineer post graduation.  I currently have my associates in engineering and associates in science degrees from Wake Techical Community College and I am in transition to a four-year college.  Currently, my local colleges do not begin their engineering degree programs until the Fall.  In the interim, I am taking some additional courses that will transfer toward my degree this Spring.  I am married and I have two boys, ages 2 and 1.  I am eager to learn more about GitHub as well as connect with other engineers here on Github.
